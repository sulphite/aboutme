Your first project is to build a showcase website. Your website should:

- [] Tell us about you;
- [] Talk about why you’d like to move into a career as a web developer;
- [x] Showcase what you’ve learnt so far;
- [x] Be built only using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript;
- [x] Not use external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, React, Jekyll themes);
- [x] Be hosted on GitHub Pages;
- [x] Link back to the GitHub repo with the code for your website.
