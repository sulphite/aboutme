          as you know I’ve been having a great time travelling and illustrating. But I think I need to start a new chapter in my life. Something creative, of course! Something that would reach a lot more people. Maybe even something that could make their lives better? And something that challenges my brain in a different way to art. I really miss all the tricky problems I had to solve at uni!

          Remember a few years ago when i did those freecodecamp courses and made some websites? That was so much fun! It’s time I got serious. I think I’ll try this web development bootcamp…

        <div class="subtitle">
          <span>Dear Diary...</span>
          <span>1st April 2023</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          I learned so much! I think I might be really good at this stuff?? And theres so much more to learn, I can’t wait! Ruby on Rails was interesting but I want to go back to javascript. I’m going to teach myself typescript and node.js and React and Svelte!!

          <span>1st January 2024</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          I've been trying so hard but I'm getting a bit tired now. I've done lots of projects and lots of learning, but I just can't seem to show it in an interview.
