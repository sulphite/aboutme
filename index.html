        </div>
          <p>
          as you know I’ve been having a great time travelling in Germany and illustrating. But I think I need to start a new chapter in my life. Something creative, of course! Something that would reach a lot more people. Maybe even something that could make their lives better? And something that challenges my brain in a different way to art. I really miss all the tricky problems I had to solve at uni!

          Remember a few years ago when i did those freecodecamp courses and made some websites? That was so much fun! It’s time I got serious. I think I’ll try this web development bootcamp…

        <div class="subtitle">
          <span>Dear Diary...</span>
          <span>1st April 2023</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          I learned so much! I think I might be really good at this stuff?? And theres so much more to learn, I can’t wait! Ruby on Rails was interesting but I want to go back to javascript, my first love. I’m going to teach myself typescript and node.js and React and Svelte!!
        </p>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <span>Dear Diary...</span>
          <span>1st December 2023</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          I've been trying so hard and I've learned so much more but it's getting really tough all by myself! And theres still so much I don't know? I've applied to so many jobs but I just can't seem to express myself well in interview. Its starting to feel like people like me aren't wanted... But I know I can do this. I'll keep working on my Typescript game.
        </p>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <span>Dear Diary...</span>
          <span>1st February 2024</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          I can't do this alone. It's time to start learning with others again. These people in the founders & coders discord seem really friendly, I wonder what this is about...

                <li>STUDENT: I've always been a very curious person, and a love of science came naturally to me. My undergrad studies were a wonderful experience</li>
                <li>LINGUIST?: during my teen years I had a slightly embarrassing obsession with Japanese. I took a course in uni, and then jumped right into an immersive 3 month course in Japan. It showed me I could handle a lot outside of my comfort zone</li>
                <li>STUDENT, AGAIN: I went to Germany, to continue studying Chemistry (and improve my german!). It didn't go so well. BUT I discovered a new passion...</li>
                <li>GAMER: here I grew to love board gaming in all its forms, from intense strategic planning through to riotous party game, and through this community I started to gain control over my social anxiety.</li>
                <li>ILLUSTRATOR: Art has always been there for me when I feel alone. Living in Berlin, I improved my skills and started freelancing.</li>
                <li>CODER???: But a poor artist can't survive in London. And so it is time for a new challenge.</li>
